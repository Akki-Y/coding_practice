Conditional statements in ruby are used to execute different blocks of code based on a particular condition. Ruby provides several conditional statements that can be used to write flexible and powerful programs. 
The most commonly used conditional statements in Ruby are if, else, elsif, unless, and case.

if statement :  If statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
      Syntax : if condition 
                 # code to excecute if condition is true
               end
               
Else statement : The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition specified in the if statement is false.
     Syntax : if condition 
                 # code to excecute if condition is true
              else
                 #  code to excecute if condition is false 
              end
              
Elseif statement : The elsif statement is used to specify multiple conditions that are checked in sequence until a true condition is found.
     Syntax : if condition1
                 # code to excecute if condition is true
              elseif condition2
                 #  code to excecute if condition is false 
              else
                 # code to execute if all conditions are false 
              end
              
Unless statement : The unless statement is used to execute a block of code if a given condition is false.     
     Syntax : unless condition
                # code to execute if condition is false
              end
              
Case statement: Case statements are used to compare a single value against multiple possible values.
     Syntax : case value
                when value1
                    # code to execute if value == value1
                when value2
                    # code to execute if value == value2
                else
                    # code to execute if value does not match any of the cases
                end
                
      
 Summary :
> Conditional statements are an essential feature of Ruby programming that allow developers to make decisions based on certain conditions. 
> The "if" statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, while the "unless" statement does the opposite, executing a block of code only if a condition is false. The "case" statement is useful for testing multiple conditions in a single statement.
