#Assignment Operators   a += b
   # These are self-assignment operators ,as they perform an assignment and arithmetic operators

a = 20
b = 30
puts a += b 
puts a -= b 
puts a *= b 
puts a /= b 
puts a %= b 
puts a **= b 

# a = a + b    a += b 

#Parallel Assignment  : This enables multiple variables to be initialized with a single unit of ruby code.
   #  Ex : a = 10 
   #       b = 20
   #       c = 30
   # parallel Asssignment ==>  a,b,c = 10,20,30

# parallel assignment is also useful for Swapping the values held in two variable
