# logical AND operator : if both operands are non zero ,then condition becomes true.
# Logical OR operator : if any of two operands are non zero ,then condition becomes true.
# logical NOT operator :  Use to reverses the logical state to its operands. if condition is true ,then logical NOT operator will make false. !(a&&b)
# Logical NOT operator :  Use to reverses the logical state to its operands. if condition is true ,then logical NOT operator will make false. not(a&&b)
