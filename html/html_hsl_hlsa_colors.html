    <h1>Hsl hsla</h1>
    <p>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.<br>
      HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).</p>
    <h2>color values</h2>
    <p>hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
      Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.<br>
      Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.<br>
      Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.<br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.<br>
      100% is pure color, no shades of gray.<br>
      50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.<br>
      0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.<br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light
      (black), 50%
      means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white).</p>

    <h1>Shades of gray</h1>
    <p>Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to
      100% to
      get darker/lighter shades</p>

    <h1>hsla color values</h1>
    <p>HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a
      color.<br>
      hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)<br>
      The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)<br>
