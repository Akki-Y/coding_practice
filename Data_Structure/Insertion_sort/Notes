Insertion Sort : We assume that first element is already sorted then, we select all unsorted elements. If unsorted element is greater than first element (sorted element) swap to right otherwise left.
Time Complexity : Big - O(n) notation

Steps: 

1. Assume ,If the first element in the array, it is already sorted. 
2. Move to the next element and store it separately in key (temp_value).
3. Now, First two elements are sorted . Take the third element and compare it with the elements on the left of it.
4. Similarly, place every unsorted element as its correct position.

RULE : Checks the next element, and comparing previous elements.
