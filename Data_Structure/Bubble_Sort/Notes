Bubble Sort : It is a type of sorting algorithm, you can use to arrange a set of values in ascending order or descending order.
Time Complexity : Big - O(n) notation

Steps :
1. Start at the beginning of the list which is unsorted list.
2. Compare the first value with the next one, if the first value is bigger swap the positions of two values.
3. Move to the second value in the list.
4. Keep going until there are no more items to compare.
5. Go back to the start of the list.

RULE : Compare and Swap

# How iterations Work :

 Ex : 5, 2, 6, 3, 1
pass - 0
2, 5, 6, 3, 1
2, 5, 3, 6, 1
2, 5, 3, 1, 6 

pass - 1
2, 3, 5, 1, 6
2, 3, 1, 5, 6

pass - 2
2, 1, 3, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
