Merge Sort :  It is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer strategy. It works by recursively dividing the array into two halves, then sort them and combine them. 
- Divide : The array or list divides itself recursively into sub-arrays until the base case is reached.
- Recursively Solved : The sub-arrays are sorted using recursion.
- Combine : It makes use of merge() to combine the sub-arrays into the final sorted array.

Time Complexity : n log n  (Worst case)

Steps: 

1. Find the middle index of the array.      mid = arr.length/2
2. Divide the array from the middle.
3. Call merge sort for the first half of the array.
4. Call merge sort for the second half of the array,
5. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

RULE : Divide , solve recusively and combine.
