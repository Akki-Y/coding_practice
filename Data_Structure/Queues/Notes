Queue : A queue follows FIFO (First - In - First - Out) method and is open at both of its end.
             Ex : Movie tickets 

Queue Operations : 
-  Enqueue : The Enqueue operation is used to add an element to the front of the queue.

Steps of the algorithm :
1. Check if the Queue is full.
2. Set the front as 0 for the first element.
3. Increase rear by 1.
4. Add the new element at the rear index.

- Dequeue : The Dequeue operation is used to remove an element from the rear of the queue.

Steps of the algorithm :
1. Check if the Queue is empty.
2. Return the value at the front index.
3. Increase front by 1.
4. Set front and rear as -1 for the last element.

- isEmpty : The isEmpty operation is used to check if the queue is empty or not.

Steps of the algorithm :
1. Check if the number of elements in the queue (size) is equal to 0, if yes, return True.
2. Return False.

- Peek : The Peek operations is used to return the front most element of the queue.

Steps of the algorithm :
1. Check if the Queue is empty.
2. Return the value at the front index.

- isFull : The isFull operation is used to check if the queue is full or not.

Steps of the algorithm :
1. Check if the number of elements in the queue (size) is equal to the capacity, if yes, return True.
2. Return False.
