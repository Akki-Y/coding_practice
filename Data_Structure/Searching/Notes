Finding target value

ALGORITHM :

1. Set two pointers, left and right, to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. Repeat until left is less than or equal to right:
3. Calculate the middle index: mid = (left + right) / 2.
4. If the middle element is the target element, return its index.
5. If the target element is less than the middle element, update right = mid - 1 (the target must be in the left half).
6. If the target element is greater than the middle element, update left = mid + 1 (the target must be in the right half).
7. If the target element is not found, return a "not found" indicator.
